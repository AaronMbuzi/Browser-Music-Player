# Browser Music Player

## Overview
Browser Music Player is a simple yet effective music player that enables you to play music stored on your local machine directly within your browser.

## Why Create This?
The motivation behind this project is personal. Currently, in my country, we are experiencing heavy load shedding. As a result, I often have to use my phone in maximum power-saving mode, which restricts the use of most applications. One of the applications I frequently use is my music player, which unfortunately becomes inaccessible under these conditions. However, I do have access to a browser even in power-saving mode, and this led to the creation of the Browser Music Player.

With this web-based music player, you can enjoy your music without worrying about the limitations imposed by power-saving settings on your phone.

## Features
- Play music files stored on your local device.
- Simple and intuitive user interface.
- Designed to work seamlessly in mobile browsers.

## How to Use
1. Open your browser and navigate to the Browser Music Player with the github Link ().
2. Upload your music files from your local storage.
3. Enjoy your music directly from your browser!
